The [Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)][1] is an extension for the
SSL protocol that helps to make HTTPS connections faster.
It was defined together with HTTP/2, and HTTP/2 uses ALPN to create HTTPS
connections. As [most browsers implement HTTP/2 only over HTTPS][2],
ALPN should be supported by any server or client implementing HTTP/2.

The OpenJDK implements SSL in the `sun.security.ssl` package.
The current implementations in Java 7 and Java 8 do not support ALPN.
With Java 9, [ALPN will become part of the Java SE standard][3],
i.e. Java 9 will provide native support for ALPN.

As long as Java 9 is not ready, an external SSL library with ALPN support must be used.
The Jetty project [provides a library with ALPN support
for `sun.security.ssl`][4].

However, as the SSL implementation is part of the Java runtime,
Jetty's ALPN JAR cannot simply be put into the CLASSPATH.
Instead, Java must be started with the parameter
`-Xbootclasspath/p:alpn-boot-VERSION.jar` to overwrite Java's boot classpath.
This only works if Jetty's ALPN version fits exactly with the OpenJDK
version used.

A table of OpenJDK versions and corresponding versions of the ALPN boot JAR
can be found [here (see table 14.1)][5]. Binary versions of the JAR can be downloaded
[here][6].
